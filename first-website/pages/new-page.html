  <p><pre>I don’t believe meaning is ever distinct from style. In terms of pedagogy, I teach toward clarity because young writers, like young skaters, tend to wear their influences in bright flashing neon signs on their foreheads. So, the correctives I offer tend toward purpose, utility,      and so on. But I also try very hard to isolate potential little shards of compelling style shining in whatever they’re doing by asking them to own the style a bit more than they want to.

  Why this flourish?
  Why this repeated syntax?
  What do you have in mind?

  The answer doesn’t have to be convincing or anything. They just need to ask the question.</pre></p>
